How is the staging area different from the working directory 
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It gives the ability to package files on any way I want them 
to get version controlled as the Staging Area may have different 
combinations of files and would not affect the working directory

=========================
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one 
commit per logical change?

By comparing the staging area files to the working area ones and 
to the repository ones.

=========================
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in 
keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

When you need to evolve your code from one check point to 
additional levels, but having more than one level to explore

=========================
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It helps to keep organized once facing a very dynamic feature 
but also very risky.

=========================
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we 
represent it in the diagram the way we do?

Merging files changed on each branch and we represent it that to 
keep tracking all changes.

=========================
What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always 
doing merges manually?

Merging automatically can obviously make unwanted changes on file,
however, if carefully and correctly used, it would save a lot of 
time when combining two versions of the same file into just one.
