How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you 
see the bug that was introduced?

Files Comparators are always helpful tools, specially when 
developing and improving applications, when changing files are 
always needed.

==========
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file 
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

First of all, with giving the mindset of evolving your 
app/program/system on tangigle and small parts/steps. 
Second, with the experience to better debugging when inputing 
new bugs to the code, it'd be lot easier to grab a working 
version and finding where the bug is.

==========
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing 
when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions 
automatically saved, like Google docs does?

I rather choose the commits myself using the logical separation 
strategy. This way, I can think myself when I might be inserting 
bugs on the routines and making it easier to fix them.

Automatically savings might get out of control as I should not 
recall what part of the code I was working on by the time of 
the automatic saving, plus, it could save stuff I didn't want 
to.

==========
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, 
allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like 
Google Docs, treat each file separately?

I really do not see why not saving multiple files. There might 
be good reasons, but I cannot see them when programming with 
using lots and multiple files.

==========
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the 
history of files?

To find release/versions of the code and compare them all for 
whatever needed.

==========
How might using version control make you more confident to 
make changes that could break something?

That's where I'm staying since the beginning. This is the beauty 
of version controlling and that's why it's something we need 
to learn how to use properly.

==========
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try 
using Git for?

For building stuff to make others people's life easier/better...
